### New Additions
 * Monsters now spawn randomly, so now you have a chance of encountering a chimera, a plague doctor, or the Boss.
 * See these changes in Version 5 of YoRPG.
### Code Restructuring
 * Modified YoRPG.java to randomly introduce a potential different monster every encounter.
# Instructions
 * "I'd like to play a little game." -Jigsaw
 * Step One: Make sure all files, including the subclasses for each Monster and Protagonist.
 * Step Two: Compile, then run YoRPG.java.
 * Step Three: You will be prompted to choose a difficulty, which affects how often you will encounter a monster.
 * Step Four: After choosing your difficulty, you will be prompted with choosing a class. Each class will have their own specialized attributes based on what it entails.
 * Step Five: You will continue to embark on your journey until you encounter a Monster. This will introduce combat.
 * Step Six: You have an option to initialize an special attack/move or a regular attack. A specialized move will raise some stats while lowering others.
  *Hint: Certain classes will boost certain stats while others go down. 
  Rogue: Lowers defense, but significantly increases attack rating
  Mage: Lowers defense but heals for a little bit of health
  Warrior: Lowers defense but boosts strength*
 * Step Seven: Your objective of the game is to survive through 5 rounds of either combat or peaceful bliss. Good luck.
